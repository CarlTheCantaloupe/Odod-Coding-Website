      <p>
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is a simple, block-based
        programming language for beginners. If you want to do some coding, at
        the top of the page, click<em> Join Scratch</em>, and follow the
        instructions for making an account. On the Scratch home page, you can
        view other people's projects as well. When you have made your account,
        click the icon of a folder. This will take you to <em>My Stuff</em>.
        Then, click <em>New project</em>. From here, you can code a program by
        dragging blocks into the scripts area pressing the green flag to run
        your brand new program. There is a help bar on the right if you need it,
        as well as a Scratch Wiki. You can explore the Scratch site, and have
        fun learning to code!

      <br />
      <p>
        <a href="https://python.org" title="Python website">Python</a> is a very
        simple programming language for beginners (but it <em>is</em> a real
        programming language). Python is a sensible next step in computer
        programmning, after Scratch. I highly recommend that you get comfortable
        with Scratch before starting with Python. Go to the
        <a href="https://python.org" title="Python website">Python website</a>,
        to download Python for Windows. If you're on Mac, Linux, BSD or another
        Unix-like system, open the terminal and type <em>python3</em> to use the
        Python shell as it is preinstalled.

      <br />
      <p>
        Javascript is a good language to know, as it is the language used to
        make responsive content on the web. It is very easy to learn. To try out
        some JavaScript, click on this <a href="about:blank">link</a> and, if
        you are on Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+J to open the JavaScript console. On
        Firefox, open the menu and click "Developer Tools".
