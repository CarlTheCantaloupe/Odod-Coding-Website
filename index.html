    <center><h3>Scratch</h3></center>
    <br />
    <p>
      <a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is a simple, block-based programming
      language for beginners. If you want to do some coding, at the top of the
      page, click<em> Join Scratch</em>, and follow the instructions for making
      an account. On the Scratch home page, you can view other people's projects
      as well. When you have made your account, click the icon of a folder. This
      will take you to <em>My Stuff</em>. Then, click <em>New project</em>. From
      here, you can code a program by dragging blocks into the scripts area
      pressing the green flag to run your brand new program. There is a help bar
      on the right if you need it, as well as a Scratch Wiki. You can explore
      the Scratch site, and have fun learning to code!

    <center><h3>Python</h3></center>
    <br />
    <p>
      <a href="http://python.org" title="Python website">Python</a> is a very
      simple programming language for beginners (but it <em>is</em> a real
      programming language). Python is a sensible next step in computer
      programmning, after Scratch. I highly recommend that you get comfortable
      with Scratch before starting with Python. Go to the
      <a href="http://python.org" title="Python website">Python website</a>, to
      download Python for Windows. If you're on Mac, Linux, BSD or another
      Unix-like system, open the terminal and type <em>python3</em> to use the
      Python shell as it is preinstalled.

    <br />
    <p>
      Javascript is a good language to know, as it is the language used to make
      responsive content on the web. It is very easy to learn. To try out some
      JavaScript, click on this <a href="about:blank">link</a> and, if you are
      on Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+J to open the JavaScript console. On Firefox,
      open the menu and click "Developer Tools".
