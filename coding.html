      <p>- Well, almost!!</p>

        <a
          href="http://scratch.mit.edu"
          title="Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share. The simplest programming language"
          >Click here</a
        >
        to go to Scratch. Scratch is a simple programming language for
        beginners. On the Scratch home page you can view other people's
        projects, or you can make an account to create your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="about:blank" title="about:blank - a blank web page"
          >Click here</a
        >
        to go to about:blank, where you can write some JavaScript. To do the
        JavaScript, hold down the keys Ctrl+Shift and press J.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> about:blank is not an ordinary web page, because:
        Have a close look at the links to Scratch, Python and Javascript. Click
        on Scratch and Python. Once you have clicked on them, they have gone
        purple. Now click on about:blank. It shouldn't have gone purple.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ANOTHER NOTE:</strong> Go on to a new tab, and search
        "about:blank", then press ENTER. It will take you to about:blank. Now go
        back to the new tab. Start typing in "abou". Unlike usual, it won't fill
        the rest in for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>YET ANOTHER NOTE:</strong> You don't have to go on to
        about:blank to do JavaScript. You can do it on any web page, but
        about:blank is good because there won't be errors or notifications in
        the console, and the HTML will be blank.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://python.org" title="Python website">Click here</a> to go
        to the Python website. Python is a very simple programming language for
        beginners (but it <em>is</em> a real programming language).
      </p>
      <h2>Further into these three languages</h2>
      <h3>Scratch</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to do some coding, at the top of the page, click<em>
          Join Scratch</em
        >, and follow the instructions for making an account. Also, on the
        Scratch home page, you can view other people's projects. Anyway, when
        you have made your account, click the icon of a folder. This will take
        you to <em>My Stuff</em>. Then, click <em>New project</em>. From here,
        you can code a program by dragging blocks into the scripts area and
        either clicking on your script or pressing the green flag to run it.
        There is a help bar on the right if you need it, as well as a Scratch
        Wiki. You can explore the Scratch site, and have fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> There is no syntax, so you can't get an error.
      </p>
      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>
        Python is probably the next step in programmning. I highly recommend
        that you get comfortable with Scratch before starting with Python. When
        you go to the
        <a href="http://python.org" title="Python website">Python website</a>,
        if you don't want to download the Python shell, you can still use the
        online console to do some stuff.
      </p>
      <h4>How to get to the online console</h4>
      <p>
        1. Go to the
        <a href="http://python.org" title="Python website">Python website</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Don't scroll or click anyhting. On the front page, there is a
        slideshow about Python. On that slideshow is this sign: >_. Click on it,
        and it will give you the online console.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> To get the >_ sign, you need to hover your mouse
        over the slideshow.
      </p>
      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Javascript is a good language to know, as it is the language used to
        make everything on the web. It has quite a simple syntax.
      </p>
      <h4>Wait a sec, what's syntax?</h4>
      <p>
        Syntax is the rules about how you lay out the things in a language, like
        the grammar.
